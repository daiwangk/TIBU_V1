# PROGRESS — living log (newest entry on top)

Every AI session starts by reading **Now** and ends by adding a **Log** entry. When a tool runs out of quota mid-task, write the entry anyway (or ask the tool to) so the next tool or person can continue.

## Now
- Week: 1 (28 Sep – 2 Oct 2026) · Milestone 1 target: end of Week 2
- Data source on preview: `mock`
- Last green commit on main: `a7a66a0`
- In progress: `A1.2 — dk — chore/a1-2-supabase` (finish: copy `supabase/` into repo + save `docs/kit/rpc-signatures.txt`)
- Blocked: —
- Waiting on client: accounts-request message (docs/build/08_CLIENT_COMMS.md §3) — sent 27 Sep for GitHub + Supabase org; Cloudflare, Resend, and domain access still to be requested · decisions list (docs/build/08_CLIENT_COMMS.md §2) not yet sent

## Log

### 2026-09-27 · B1.1 / B1.2 / A1.2 · dk · Cursor
- Done:
  - Solo session: dk covered both A and B tracks (no partner session)
  - B1.1: done, merged to main (`f27d73b`) — boot patch + Desserts category filtering
  - B1.2: done, merged to main (`a7a66a0`) — hygiene (AGENTS.md, rules, guards, CI, legacy folders)
  - A1.2 (partial): `tibu-dev` Supabase project created; migrations pushed; cron scheduled and verified
  - `tibu-prod` project also created today (ahead of Week 5 / A5.2) — left untouched (no migrations, no seed)
- Files: `src/Desserts.jsx`, `src/Home.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`, ViewAll defaults, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/`, `.cursor/`, `.github/`, `scripts/` (B1.2)
- How verified: `npm run build` green; B1.1/B1.2 on `main` (`f27d73b`, `a7a66a0`); A1.2 cron verified on `tibu-dev`
- Not done / left out (why):
  - A1.2 still open: `supabase/` folder (migrations, cron.sql, tests) not yet copied into this repo
  - `docs/kit/rpc-signatures.txt` not yet saved
- Next step (exact): finish A1.2 (copy `supabase/` into repo + save rpc-signatures), then proceed to B1.3
- Gotchas for the next person:
  - Cursor does **not** auto-load `AGENTS.md` from `.cursor/rules/tibu.mdc` — attach `@AGENTS.md` explicitly each new chat, or paste Session Opener (`docs/build/prompts/00_SESSION_AND_RESCUE.md` S1) first
